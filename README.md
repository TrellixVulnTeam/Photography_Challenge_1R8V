## About :point_down:

A four page photography site  
<br>
This project was created from scratch using grid for the main layout and **BEM** method.

Built with a mobile first approach.
<br>
<br>
Deployed using [Github-pages](https://colinthedev.github.io/Photography_Challenge/)

## Final Considerations

This project made me much more comfortable using CSS grid.  
<br>
It was great practice with responsive design.

I am really happy with how this turned out, and i had a blast making it! :rocket:
